Prerequisites
Before you can run this app, you need to install the following software:

Download and install Visual Studio 2022 (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
Important: During installation, make sure to select the .NET Multi-platform App UI development workload
Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

2. .NET 9.0 SDK

The app requires .NET 9.0 or later (NB!!!)
This is usually included with Visual Studio 2022, but you can download it separately from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Windows 10 version 1809 or later
Windows App SDK (included with Visual Studio)
